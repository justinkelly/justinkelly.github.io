message: "Thank you very much for this extension! I also think there was a lot of space not being used on the standard card view, especially considering I use several checklists on each card. Having to scroll up and down all the time was a real pain.\r\n\r\nThis is probably more than a simple extension can do, but do you think maybe you could add a funcionality that divides the card view in columns? Like, for example, the add buttons (members, labels, checklists, etc.) could be on the right hand side, where they already are; description, attachments and checklists could be on the left-hand side, while comments could be in the middle column. \r\n\r\nThe ideal scenario would be one in which you could drag and drop these elements to certain places on the card, like you can do now with checklists (albeit only vertically), but I know this is probably something only the developers at Trello could implement. Doesn't hurt to ask, though.\r\n\r\nAgain thank you very much for this extension!\r\n\r\nCheers."
