message: "`$uri` is suppose to stay as it is but when I execute the script it converted to empty value I guess script is taking it as a variable and replacing it empty value. Any Idea how to fix?\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n`location / {try_files $uri $uri/ @forum;}` becomes `location / {try_files / @forum;}`"
