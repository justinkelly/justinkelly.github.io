<p>Whats new<br />- users management <br />- you can now add/edit users in Simple Invoices <br />- no more phpmyadmin nonsense <br />- multiple taxes per line item <br />- just adjust the number of taxes per line item in System Preferences to show the number you require <br />- UI updates - Simple Invoices is now using 970px wide layout instead of 100% width <br />- email as pdf working now <br />- email - now allow multiple email addresses in to or bcc and can be delimited via , or&#160;; - thanks stella <br />- add system pref for number of taxes per line item <br />- sql patch 163 - tax conversion patch updated</p>
<p>Known issues <br />- customer view info tabs - not happy - need to be redone in jquery UI <br />- can&#8217;t close yellow text <br />- backup db - once db backed up - menu goes wierd <br />- IE - menu not all nice <br />- no data validation on form input <br />- postgres version not complete <br />- total style invoice not selectable <br />- Help link - top right - not working <br />- Reports - not localised - ie. in 6 decimal places <br />- PHP.ini max memory needs to be min 64M to handle new PDF</p>

<p>How to help out <br />- try upgrading a database from an older version (pre 2009.1 beta2) and make sure all the invoices are still OK <br />- create invoices using a few different scenarios and then edit them - etc.. <br />- make sure the invoice is 100% ok in all the differents <br />- are you a css guru? i need someone to help fix the css round the menus - issue in IE and also with side borders <br />- post on the forum - <a href="http://simpleinvoices.org">http://simpleinvoices.org</a> if you find any issues</p>
