just got a netgear dgn2000 adsl2+  modem / wireless N router, opened the box and first thought was, 
whats happened to netgear? 

instead of the solid metal box that my current 802.11g box is this is cheapo plastic and doesnt 
include mount points so i can't be hung from a wall etc. as the old netgears could

###Good
- web based setup wizard actually worked fine for optus

### Bad:
- not mountable
-- how im ganna put this on the wall will be interesting
- plastic
-- bring back the solid metal netgear cases of old
- admin page hasn't seemed to of progress in the last 5 years

### Conclusion

- netgear was once awesome - this is not
- it works but for the price you pay for i expect more from netgear
