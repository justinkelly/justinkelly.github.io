just got a hp mini 2140 HD netbook

finally a great netbook with high-res (1366 x 768) HD display, 6 cell battery,
linux, great keyboard, and metal/brushed aluminium case

for whatever reason HP AU has made is almost impossible to get one of these.  
all agents and hp call centre people I spoke to said only the low res (SD) 
model was available and that the HD "might" be available in a few months

thanks for unwoken for the whirlpool forums for forwarding me the details of the *only*
p au staff who is willing sell me one of these - from searches and forum posting there
s so much demand for this model - can't see why hp is hiding them

the ordered model came with novell/suse linux - but if you want a great netbook 
- just grab the latest [linux mint](http://www.linuxmint.com) and everything with work perfect

HP USA seems to have discontinued the 2140 in favour of the 5150 - but the 2 can't compare

## quick summary

### pro
- best netbook going around
- great keyboard
- great build quality
- come with linux - if you ask

### con
- impossible to get the HD model in AUS
- those bloody LED lights at the front are way to bright

if your lucky still might be able to get one from the US via [www.priceusa.com.au](http://www.priceusa.com.au)
