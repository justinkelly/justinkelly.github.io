thought my vps over at <a href="http://fsckvps.com" target="_blank">fsckvps.com</a> had been having a good run recently, that was until last night - fsckvps has been down for 12 hours and counting<p /><div>thank god for external site monitoring tools like basicstate and was it up? - if it was up to fsckvps they would never of noticed<br /> <p /><div>@fsckvps - im pretty sure with a 12 hours+ outage you won&#39;t be making that 99.5% uptime SLA this month</div><p /><div>looks like i might have to move vps providers again - most likely to <a href="http://prgmr.com/xen/" target="_blank">http://prgmr.com/xen/</a> - they seem to be working well for <a href="http://pinboard.in" target="_blank">pinboard.in</a></div> </div>
