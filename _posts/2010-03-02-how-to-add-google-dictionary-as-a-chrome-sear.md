Just noticed that Google now has their own Dictionary site: [www.google.com/dictionary](http://www.google.com/dictionary)

Looks great but to make it really useful for me (as someone who can't spell) here a simple way to add 
Google Dictionary into the Chrome web browser as a search engine - This way I can easily test the spelling or whatever words i want

In Chrome 

1. Go to Tools menu
1. then Options
1. and in the Default Search section click Manage
1. click Add and enter the below details in the available fields

```
Name: Google Dictionary
Keyword: spell
URL: http://www.google.com/dictionary?langpair=en|en&amp;q=%s
```

Refer image below:

Now just type spell followed by the word your testing ie. `spell archive`
in the chrome address box and it&#39;ll auto use Google Dictionary ( refer image below)

the end result is you'll be auto send to a page like: http://www.google.com/dictionary?langpair=en|en&amp;q=archive
