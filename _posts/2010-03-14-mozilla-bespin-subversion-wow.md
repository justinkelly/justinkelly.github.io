when mozilla first launched bespin - a browser based text editor - i was interested
but a number of required features were still lacking

now that bespin supports various version control systems (Subversion, Mercurial, and more on the way)
its well on the way to becoming a very useful coding text editor

bespin can now checkout and commit changes to your SVN or Hg repo<

is this useful ?

* being able to work (edit, add, delete files ) with SVN via a browser is a killer feature 
  * making bespin the perfect alternative text editor when you're not on your normal PC
* no need to setup svn, eclipse, vi etc.. on each PC you work on
  * just set it up in bespin and you can access it from anywhere !!
