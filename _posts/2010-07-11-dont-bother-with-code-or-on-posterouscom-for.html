<p>if you ever need to post code on <a href="http://posterous.com">posterous.com</a> don't bother with [code] or &lt;mardown&gt; - especially in chrome - its evil, text just goes all over the place - just paste it in <a href="http://gist.github.com/">http://gist.github.com/</a> and past the gist link in the post - done, too easy</p>
