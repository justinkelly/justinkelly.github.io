I've searched the web for a simple way to detect all the different mobile 
devices ( iphones, andriod, etc..) with javascript but couldn't find anything decent.

This is what i've come up with and has worked for me

{% gist 621607 %}

Let me know if you find any issues or have enhancements

update: 9th March 2012 to included Windows Phone OS 7 +
