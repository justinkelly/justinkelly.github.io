<p>Over the years I tried about every task manager / todo list type app and web app available - but never really stuck with 1. &nbsp;I did use Google Tasks for a while but since I started using <a href="http://workflowy.com" target="_blank">workflowy.com</a> I haven't looked back</p>
<p />
<div>As a task manager it got almost no features - but that and its fantasic UI - super easy add/editing/indenting/unindenting/etc. are what make it perfect</div>
<p />
<div>I use it to jot down everything - not just task</div>
<div>-- contact list, journal, random thoughts and info etc..</div>
<p />
<div>Its amazingly easy to use - If you have the need to record info I recommend you check it out</div>
<p />
<div>Once they get list sharing and edit notifications working this will free me of my need for google docs and wiki for private&nbsp;collaboration&nbsp;</div>
