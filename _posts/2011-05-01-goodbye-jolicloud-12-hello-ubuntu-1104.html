<div>I've been using <a href="http://www.jolicloud.com">Jolicloud</a> on my netbook since December and really enjoyed using, that was until Ubuntu 11.04 was releaed&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>Whats great in Jolicloud</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>integrated&nbsp;your Google Docs and Dropbox files into your OS like normal files</li>
<li>all your apps and preferences are store on <a href="http://jolicloud.com">jolicloud.com</a></li>
<li>when you reinstall or setup a new laptop all your apps and settings are all auto installed and setup for you</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Problems with Jolicloud</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Apps disappear behind the jolicloud desktop and can't be alt-tab to etc.. - really annoying</li>
<li>The jolicloud file browser is really slow and a pain to use
<ul>
<li>yeah it looks nice but plain old nautilus is much better</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>its just not as nice to use as ubuntu with unity desktop</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Whats great about Ubuntu `11.04 on a netbook</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Unity desktop is fantastic - there was tonnes of negative press re Unity before the launch of 11.04</li>
<li>Everything pretty much 'just works'</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Problems with Ubuntu on a netbook</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>The GDM pre-login sound can't be disabled via a GUI, really annoying when your working in a quiet environment (&nbsp;i'll post next about how to fix this )</li>
<li>On a netbook when you click an app in the The Unity apps launcher on the left its very hard to tell if anything is happening, yeah the background of the icon pulses but on a small screen this is really hard to see. &nbsp;This needs to be changed so the icon 'jumps' like OSX or something similar so you can actually see something happening after you click it&nbsp;</li>
<li>Needs to be an easy way to find out what the Unity keyboard shortcuts are, Super-W and Super-S are fantastic - but I would never have found them if I didn't read about them in some comments on some a blog</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Apart from those minor issues I can't recommend Ubuntu 11.04 enough</div>
