A little over a year ago Jason Stachan posted on HN offering a days design work for free to any project ( <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1194567">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1194567</a> ), luckily SimpleInvoices.org was chosen and Jason produced a great design: [jasonstrachan.com/clients/simpleinvoices](http://jasonstrachan.com/clients/simpleinvoices)
 
Thanks to a number of our great community members Jasons design has been transformed into html/css reality and weve skinned dokuwiki and vanilla forum with his design

- [simpleinvoices.org](http://simpleinvoices.org) and [simpleinvoices.org/forum](http://simpleinvoices.org/forum)
 
Also just noticed Jason has posted again offerring his services [news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2655618](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2655618) - good luck to all those who apply - you'll get a great design
 
Thanks again HN, Jason, and the SimpleInvoices.org communityÂ
