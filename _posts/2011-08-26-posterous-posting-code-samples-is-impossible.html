<p>i tried posting from within a plain text email, wasnt happy, tried in the HTML editor for the post and normal view still nothing</p>
<p>and yes I used 4 spaces before the code within markdown tags</p>
<p>please can you update your editor to something good - think Google Sites editor - not some crappy TinyMCE clone</p>
<p>for any code more than 1 line i just use a gist in the post - its just works</p>
