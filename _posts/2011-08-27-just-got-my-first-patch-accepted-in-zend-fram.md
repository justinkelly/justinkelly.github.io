About a year and a half ago I submitted a small patch to the Zend Framework, 
[http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-9577](http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-9577),
great to see that if has now been commited in and will be in the next 1.11 release

thanks to @ralphschindler for cleaning it up and writing the test [http://framework.zend.com/code/comp.php?repname=Zend+Framework&amp;compare[]=/@24411&amp;compare[]=/@24412](http://framework.zend.com/code/comp.php?repname=Zend+Framework&amp;compare[]=/@24411&amp;compare[]=/@24412)
