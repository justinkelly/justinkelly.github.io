In honour of the [publishing](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=no&tl=en&u=http://www.dagensit.no/article2411857.ece) of
almost 7 million LinkedIn.com passwords I'm announcing the 7th June annual 'Reset your password' day.

If your wondering if your password was leaked and broken refer [leakedin.org](leakedin), its a great site that siftes
through the released password.

Anyway this release is a great way to remember to that your passwords are stored in all over the web. 
If there are any sites you don't need to access anymore it' best to delete these accounts

Each June the 7th I'll be changeing all the paswords from now on

If your looking for a new safer password refer this great comic from xkcd
