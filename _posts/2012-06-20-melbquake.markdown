_tlrl; google plus fails #melbquake_

Melbourne experienced a small earthquake last night, like alot of people I went online right away to see
what was going on, and what I experienced says alot about the current state of social media

### What I expected to see when i turned the PC on

When theres something major like an earthquake in the city I'm in, this is what I expect to see

### What actual happened

Went to Google news - it said nothign about an earthquake

Went to Google Plus - it said nothing about an earthquake.  I was expecting to see #eathquake ot #melbquake trending.  
Except all that was trending was euro2012 stuff (which not many people in melbourne care about)

Went to the website of the main [newspaper](http://theage.com.au) - it said nothing about an earthquake

Went to twitter - it was full of very funny and informative tweets from all over the city about the earthquake

Best tweet goes to

After 15 minutes went back to the newspaper sites had some some quick stories mashed together from various tweets

Afer a while I logged into facebook to see what other Melbournians where saying - There was alot less posts about the earthquake
than I had expected, and non to the level of humour or informative of the news coming out of twitter.

### Google Plus fail

I has expected given the volume of tweets from Melbourne, 30000 in 30 minutes usign #melbquake to see this trending on google plus.

But google showed nothing, searched on G+ for #melbquake and #earthquake revealed plenty of great (informative, funny, and timely) posts
- so why was it not trending?

### Conclusion

I really like Google Plus and was hoping the good info would be there - just didn't happen

Twitter is where its at, facebook was uninspired, google plus could of been great but wasn't.

Google Plus has alot of great real time news info, but:

* their trending engine doesn't account for location 
* or react to the huge spikes in a very short time frame
