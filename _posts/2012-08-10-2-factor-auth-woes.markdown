Given the recent [dramas](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/all/) with online account being hacked I've turned on 2 factor auth for my Google Apps accounts

Works great, easy enough to use but ..

The verification code SMSs are not coming through regularly on Optus mobile in Australia.  

* 50% time they come through straight away, 
* 30% they don't come through at all 
* 20% arrive between 20 minutes to 2 hours later :(

Not sure who Google uses to send SMS in Australia but it definitely has problems

2 step login is a great service from Google, just hope they can make the user experience work

Note: If your looking for info on how or why to use 2 factor auth refer this great blog post by Jeff Atwood
