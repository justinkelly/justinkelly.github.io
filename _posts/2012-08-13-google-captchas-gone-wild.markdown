There has been alot of [talk](http://blog.andrewmunsell.com/post/28232343440/captchas-are-becoming-ridiculous#.UCZRNLQgeTM) recently 
about [captchas](http://www.google.com/recaptcha) are getting to hard to read.  I signed up for another Google+ account today, I failed to enter the
first captcha correctly, the second captcha that was displayed is below - it took a number of reads before I believed Google would print something this crazy on their signup forms.

Yes, it reads `suckbroz`

Given Google is home to some of the worlds greatest minds I hope they can for a few hours stop trying to get people to click ads and really fix captchas. Either put in a decent filter so crazy stuff like this doesn't appear or fix the issue so we don't need to place captchas on sites

 I don't know what the solution is - but whatever they are doing now isn't working
