Was trying to copy a chuck of text in Vim when I accidentally pressed `u` instead of `y`. 
`u` in visual mode lowercases the selected text - I had no idea.

Text selected in visual mode:

![](/img/vim-lowercase-before.png)

After pressing `u`

![](/img/vim-lowercase-after.png)

File this one under, more Vim commands found out by randomly mashing the keyboard
