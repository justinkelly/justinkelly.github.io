Didn’t know that this was even possible - but there is now spam in Google Calendars

If you have the default Google Calendar settings it allows anyone to insert an event into your calendar. 
The reason for this is that Google Calendar shows event invites even if you haven’t accepted or read the email

To fix this go to Settings in Google Calendar and change the below 2 options to `No`

I searched my email for the contents of the meeting but couldn’t find anything matching. 
I assume someone sent a spam email - with an invite , Google caught the spam and deleted it but allowed the calendar event to stay

If you have the default settings in Google Calendar just set them to `No` and this problem will go away
