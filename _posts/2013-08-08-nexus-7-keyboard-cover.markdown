The good folks at [MobileZap][2](AU version of MobileFun.co.uk) sent over a bluetooth [keyboard case][1] for my Nexus 7(2012) to review. 

Currently this is the only hard cover aluminium - clip on - case for the Nexus 7 on the market
(though is availble as a few different brands) thats similar to Logitechs offerings for the iPad.

This is a mini keyboard to match the size of the Nexus 7, its pretty much the same size and quality of the original
[Asus Eee 701 PC](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=eeepc+701) keyboard

### The Good

Works perfect with the Nexus 7 (2012 version), all normal keys, media, and Android specific keys 'just work'.  The Nexus 7 fits in perfectly in portrait
and landscape mode and the case clips on and looks just like the Nexus 7.

The bluetooth pairing worked without a hitch and only took a few seconds. Battery life so far seems good, its rechargable via the same
USB cable as the Nexus 7.

It's a very minimal design - unlike some of the chunky leather style keyboard cases, making it perfect for when a 
laptop is too big and a plain tablet to slow for writing.

I logged into a linux server via SSH and fired up Vim to see how it would work for coding and its definitely better 
for coding than any touch/virtual coding keyboards for Android. It's not as easy to type on as a full size keyboard
but for the size it's as good as I expect.  Only issue with using the keyboard in Vim or SSH is the lack of an Escape key, thankfully you
can use `Ctrl+[` to do the same as `Esc` in Vim.

### The Bad

The backing of this case is hard plastic rather than the soft material the nexus 7 uses.  This 
is great for protecting the Nexus 7 when the case is clipped as a cover but when
your using it to type on a hard surface it can slid around as you type. Though easily fixed 
with a small piece of anti-slip rubber glued on the back.

### Overall

If you need a keyboard for your Nexus 7 for occasional typing - such as taking notes in class or lectures, or writing 
longer docs and emails this is a great budget keyboard case for the Nexus 7.  It's not going to magically turn your Nexus 7 into
a full laptop/desktop replacement but does a great job for when a tablet is more suitable.
