After picking up a couple of [Motorola Moto G](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Moto_G) phones on the weekend
I set about looking for a couple of different covers for them so as to not destroy yet another phone. 
The good guys over at [MozileZap](http://www.mobilezap.com.au/35004/motorola/moto-g/covers.htm) set over a couple of cases to review.

The first up is the Cruzerlite Bugdroid case.

## The Good

 * Looks great, made of a hard rubber so its strong and will bounce if needed.
 * Nice and thick material. Doesn't feel cheap or slippery.
 * Super easy to install as unlike the Motorola Grip shell there's no need to remove the back plate of the Moto G
 * Personally I like the cutouts for the power and volume rocker, other [cases](motorola-grip-shell-for-moto-g-review/) wrap over the buttons affecting their use.

Here's a drop test video of the same case on a Nexus 5:

## The Bad

 * The thickness of the hard rubber (TPU) used in this case may put off those looking for slim cases.
 * The fit isnt as tight as the [Grip Shell](motorola-grip-shell-for-moto-g-review/) and there is some minor flex on the edges.

## Conclusion 

If you're after a case that protect your phone from a drop onto concrete and don't might it being slightly chunky. This is the one for you.
